1	Fraggle Attack	"A Fraggle Attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending a large amount of spoofed UDP traffic to a router’s broadcast address within a network. It is very similar to a Smurf Attack, which uses spoofed ICMP traffic rather than UDP traffic to achieve the same goal. Given those routers (as of 1999) no longer forward packets directed at their broadcast addresses, most networks are now immune to Fraggle (and Smurf) attacks."
2	Fragmented ACK Attack	"A Fragmented ACK attack is a variation of the ACK & PSH-ACK Flood that uses 1500-byte packets with the goal of hogging the target network’s bandwidth with only a moderate packet rate. If application level filters were applied on network equipment (routers and such), it will have to reassemble the packets, consuming much of its resources. If no filters were applied, these attack packets will be able to pass through many network security devices such as routers, ACLs, and firewalls undetected. These fragmented packets usually contain junk data, as the goal of the attacker is to simply consume all of the target network’s bandwidth."
3	HTTP Flood	"An HTTP flood is an attack method used by hackers to attack web servers and applications. It consists of seemingly legitimate session-based sets of HTTP GET or POST requests sent to a target web server. These requests are specifically designed to consume a significant amount of the server’s resources, and therefore can result in a denial-of-service condition (without necessarily requiring a high rate of network traffic). Such requests are often sent en masse by means of a botnet, increasing the attack’s overall power.HTTP flood attacks may be one of the most advanced non-vulnerability threats facing web servers today. It is very hard for network security devices to distinguish between legitimate HTTP traffic and malicious HTTP traffic, and if not handled correctly, it could cause a high number of false-positive detections. Rate-based detection engines are also not successful at detecting HTTP flood attacks, as the traffic volume of HTTP floods may be under detection thresholds. Because of this, it is necessary to use several parameters detection including rate-based and rate-invariant."
4	HTTP Fragmentation Attack	"In an HTTP Fragmentation Attack, an attacker establishes a valid connection with a server, and then proceeds to send all of his or her HTTP traffic to the server in small fragments as slowly as possible. Some web servers (such as Apache) have improper timeout mechanisms, and therefore allow for this behavior. The web server is essentially allowing legitimate users with slow or intermittent connections to send their data fragmented to multiple packets. Waiting to receive such malicious user data causes the server to maintain long-lasting sessions and the attackers can cause exhaustion to the server’s connection table, resulting in a denial-of-service condition."
5	ICMP Flood	"nternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a connectionless protocol used for IP operations, diagnostics, and errors. An ICMP Flood - the sending of an abnormally large number of ICMP packets of any type (especially network latency testing “ping” packets) - can overwhelm a target server that attempts to process every incoming ICMP request, and this can result in a denial-of-service condition for the target server."
6	Low rate attack	"Attack aimed at bringing a target down but doing so quietly. This is much different than high rate brute force attacks. These attacks often aim at leaving connections open on the target by creating a relatively low number of connections over a period of time and leaving those sessions open for as long as possible. Common methods include sending partial http requests, such as Slowloris, and Slowpost (a DDoS tool which completes the handshake) and sending small data packets or keep alives in order to keep the session from going to idle timeout. These attack vectors are often intermingled with the high rate volumetric attacks and fly under the radar making them not only very hard to block but also to detect."
7	Man-in-the-Middle Attack	"A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack involves an attacker intruding on an existing connection, establishing himself or herself as a “man-in-the-middle”, or someone able to intercept and selectively modify all network traffic between two communicating devices.  If Alice is attempting to communicate with Bob, a MitM attack on Alice (by attacker Charlie) would occur as follows:      1. Charlie redirects Alice’s network traffic destined for Bob to himself.      2. Charlie takes note of Alice’s public key used to encrypt her data, and re-encrypts her now unencrypted data with his own public key, sending it to Bob.      3. Bob decrypts Alice’s information encrypted with Charlie’s public key (unaware that it isn’t Alice’s key) and sends his reply encrypted with his own public key.      4. Charlie receives Bob’s reply to Alice encrypted with Bob’s public key, takes note of it, and re-encrypts Bob’s reply with his own public key, and sends it to Alice. Alice receives Bob’s message encrypted with Charlie’s public key (unaware that it isn’t Bob’s key), and this process continues, with Charlie able to read and potentially modify any messages sent between Alice and Bob without either one of them knowing.  "
8	Ping of Death	"The “Ping of Death” is an antiquated denial-of-service (DoS) attack that does not affect modern machines. Originally, a bug was discovered in the TCP/IP framework of many operating systems in the mid 1990s, where sending a large packet (greater than the maximum allowable size of 65,535 bytes) to a target machine would result in it becoming severely unstable, crashing, or rebooting it.  This attack was made possible because such a large packet had to be reassembled on the receiving machine. When packet fragments were reassembled into a packet larger than the maximum allowable size of 65,535 bytes on the target machine, a buffer overflow occurred, causing instability, crashing or rebooting of the targeted machine."
9	Privacy Breach	Due to little or no encryption data can be read from the communication hence giving information to a malicious listener about the device.
10	Reflector - Reflective DoS attacks	"Reflection Denial of Service attacks makes use of a potentially legitimate third party component to send the attack traffic to a victim, ultimately hiding the attackers’ own identity. The attackers send packets to the reflector servers with a source IP address set to their victim’s IP therefore indirectly overwhelming the victim with the response packets. The reflector servers used for this purpose could be ordinary servers not obviously compromised, which makes this kind of attack particularly difficult to mitigate. A common example for this type of attack is Reflective DNS Response attack."
11	Replay Attack	"A replay attack (also known as playback attack) is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and re-transmits it, possibly as part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution."
12	Session Hijacking	Exploitation of a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. Also known as cookie hijacking.
13	Slow-Rate Attack	"Slow-Rate, or “Low and Slow” attacks involve apparently legitimate traffic arriving at a seemingly legitimate albeit slow rate. Attack tools such as Slowloris, Sockstress, and R.U.D.Y. produce legitimate packets at a slow rate, allowing the packets to pass traditional mitigation strategies undetected. Traffic from such attacks is often hard to detect because it looks like legitimate traffic on OSI Model Layer 7 (the Application Layer) to lower-level security devices."
14	Smurf Attack	"A Smurf Attack (named so as it fits the stereotype of Smurfs with proper visualization) is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending ICMP echo requests (ping) traffic to the broadcast address of routers and other network devices in large computer networks with a spoofed source address (the address of the desired DoS target). Since the device receiving the original ICMP echo request broadcasts it to every other device it’s connected to, each one of these devices sends out an echo reply to the spoofed source address (the DoS target). This will generate a high rate of ICMP traffic and could cause DoS or instability for the target network."
15	Sockstress	"Sockstress is an attack tool that exploits vulnerabilities in the TCP stack allowing an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition for a target server. In the normal TCP three-way handshake, a client sends a SYN packet to the server, the server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, and the client responds to the SYN-ACK with an ACK, establishing a connection. Attackers using Sockstress establish a normal TCP connection with the target server but they send a “window size 0” packet to the server inside the last ACK, instructing it to set the size of the TCP window to 0 bytes.  The TCP Window is a buffer that stores the received data before it uploads it up to the application layer. The Widow Size field indicates how much more room is in the buffer in each point of time. Window size set to zero means that there is no more space whatsoever and that the other side should stop sending more data until further notice. In this case the server will send window size probe packets to the client continually to see when it can accept new information, but because the attacker does not change the window size, the connection is kept open indefinitely.  By opening many connections of this nature to a server, the attacker consumes all of the space in the server’s TCP connection table (as well as other tables), preventing legitimate users from establishing a connection. Alternately, the attacker can open many connections with a very small (around 4-byte) window size, forcing the server to break up information into a massive number of tiny 4-byte chunks. Many connections of this type will consume a server’s available memory, also causing a denial-of-service."
16	SQL Injection	"SQL injection is an attack targeting web applications taking advantage of poor application coding where the inputs are not sanitized therefore exposing application vulnerabilities. SQL injection is the most famous type of injection attacks which also count LDAP or XML injections. The idea behind a sql injection is to modify an application SQL (database language) query in order to access or modify unauthorized data or run malicious programs. Most web applications indeed rely on databases where the application data is stored and being accessed by SQL queries and modifications of these queries could mean taking control of the application. An attacker would for example be able to access the application database with administrator access, run remote commands on the server, drop or create objects in the database and more"
17	SYN Flood	"A SYN flood is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that relies on abusing the standard way that a TCP connection is established. Typically, a client sends a SYN packet to an open port on a server asking for a TCP connection. The server then acknowledges the connection by sending SYN-ACK packet back to the client and populating the client’s information in its Transmission Control Block (TCB) table. The client then responds to the server with an ACK packet establishing the connection. This process is commonly known as a “three-way handshake”. A SYN flood overwhelms a target machine by sending thousands of connection requests to it using spoofed IP addresses. This causes the target machine to attempt to open a connection for each malicious request and subsequently wait for an ACK packet that never arrives. A server under a SYN flood attack will continue to wait for a SYN-ACK packet for each connection request, as the delay could be normal and related to network congestion. However, because a SYN-ACK packet never arrives for any of the connection requests; the massive number of half-open connections quickly fills up the server’s TCB table before it can time any connections out."
18	SYN-ACK Flood	"A SYN-ACK flood is an attack method that involves sending a target server spoofed SYN-ACK packet at a high rate. Because a server requires significant processing power to understand why it is receiving such packets out-of-order (not in accordance with the normal SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK TCP three-way handshake mechanism), it can become so busy handling the attack traffic, that it cannot handle legitimate traffic and hence the attackers achieve a denial-of-service condition."
19	TCP Window Scaling	"The TCP Window is a buffer that contains a copy of all the packets sent out by a device in case any of the packets are lost in transit (in which case they can be replaced using this buffer and resent minimizing packet loss).  As a result, the TCP Window should be large enough to hold a copy of all packets still in transit; otherwise, network traffic will be severely throttled. The other extreme, is a large TCP window that can consume a significant amount of memory on a device.  The most optimal TCP Window size can be approximated using the equation Window Size (in bytes) = Bandwidth (in bit/s) * Round Trip Time (In sec) / 8.  Since TCP does not know how much memory to reserve for the TCP Window, most operating systems have the ability to dynamically resize TCP Windows for each network connection. For a 20 Mb/s downstream 1 Mb/s upstream link and a max round trip time of 250 ms (fairly average), the maximum receive window size should be about 625 KB and the maximum send window size should be about 32 KB."
20	Teardrop Attack	"Teardrop attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending fragmented packets to a target machine. Since the machine receiving such packets cannot reassemble them due to a bug in TCP/IP fragmentation reassembly, the packets overlap one another, crashing the target network device. This generally happens on older operating systems such as Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, Windows NT and versions of the Linux kernel prior to 2.1.63.  One of the fields in an IP header is the “fragment offset” field, indicating the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If the sum of the offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition."
21	THC-SSL DoS	"THC-SSL DOS was developed by a hacking group called The Hacker’s Choice (THC), as a proof-of-concept to encourage vendors to patch a serious SSL vulnerability. THC-SSL-DOS, as with other “low and slow” attacks, requires only a small number of packets to cause denial-of-service for a fairly large server. It works by initiating a regular SSL handshake and then immediately requesting for the renegotiation of the encryption key, constantly repeating this server resource-intensive renegotiation request until all server resources have been exhausted."
22	UDP Flood	"A UDP flood is a network flood and still one of the most common floods today. The attacker sends UDP packets, typically large ones, to single destination or to random ports. In most cases the attackers spoof the SRC IP which is easy to do since the UDP protocol is “connectionless” and does not have any type of handshake mechanism or session.  The main intention of a UDP flood is to saturate the Internet pipe. Another impact of this attack is on the network and security elements on the way to the target server, and most typically the firewalls. Firewalls open a state for each UDP packet and will be overwhelmed by the UDP flood connections very fast."
23	Unauthorized Control	"Due to no authentication, a device can be controlled directly by a malicious attaker"
24	Weak Authentication	"Devices often contain default passwords and usernames such as admin:admin, for SSH/Telnet/HTTP connection. Trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords. Dictionaries can be created with common password and usernames, and simple programs can quickly try to access the device using these passwords."
25	Weak Encryption	"Encryption is used to hide the data from malicious users. The device uses a key that malicious users don't know and is used in an algorithm to encrypt the data. If the key is too simple, or the algorithm is poorly implemented then the data can be easily unencrypted. Weak algorithms include DES, RC4, IDEA and Blowfish."
26	Password Transmission	Password is seen in the communciation transmission
